# Database migrations

Migrations use ordered filenames in the form NNNN_description.sql and are applied once in lexical order.

Set DATABASE_URL and run:

    npm run db:migrate

The runner creates schema_migrations, applies each migration in its own transaction, stores a SHA-256 checksum, and refuses to silently re-run or accept edits to an already-applied migration. Add a new numbered file for every later schema change.

The canonical data-model migration is additive and preserves legacy tables and columns still used by the existing API. It backfills profiles, preferences, providers, models, usage, memory, and audit aliases where possible.

Existing installations initialized with database/schema.sql can run the migration runner afterwards. New installations should use the migration runner as the schema source of truth. The older schema.sql remains a legacy bootstrap/reference file until all environments have migrated.

See BACKUP-RESTORE.md for the documented backup and recovery procedure. Never commit database dumps or secrets.

Locale persistence is introduced by `0003_user_locale_settings.sql`. It creates `user_settings.locale` and backfills it from existing account preferences. Apply it with the normal migration runner before deploying the updated account API.
